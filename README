Cakeupload plugin
-----------------

A few days ago we were using the swfupload object to upload files inside our cake project.
After a small configuration change in the project, the uploader component just blew away and started throwing a IOException (no trace, no clues) error.
Probably it's our fault, but we were totally dissapointed with that...

This plugin is the natural reaction to that feeling.
